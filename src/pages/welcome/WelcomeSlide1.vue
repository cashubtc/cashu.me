            </p>
            <p>
              These Terms of Service (these "Terms") constitute the entire
              agreement and understanding between you ("you" or "your") and
              Cashu.me ("Cashu.me," "we," "us," or "our") regarding your use of
              the Cashu.me website and any related applications, software, code,
              or services (collectively, the "Site" or "Services"). By accessing
              or using the Site or Services, you acknowledge that you have read,
              understand, and agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not
              agree, do not access or use the Site or Services.
            </p>
            <p><strong>1. Nature of the Services</strong></p>
            <p>
              1.1 <strong>Non-Custodial Web Application:</strong> Cashu.me
              provides a non-custodial web application ("wallet") that is
              executed entirely on your device. Our Site merely makes available
              client-side code implementing the open-source Cashu protocol. We
              do not run a server that holds your ecash or executes transactions
              on your behalf.
            </p>
            <p>
              1.2 <strong>No Control Over Mints:</strong> Cashu.me does not
              issue ecash and does not operate or control any Mint. The choice
              of any Mint and any transaction or relationship you establish with
              that Mint is solely between you and that Mint. Cashu.me has no
              involvement, responsibility, or liability in any such interaction.
            </p>
            <p>
              1.3 <strong>No Funds Access:</strong> At no time does Cashu.me
              have custody, possession, or control of your ecash. Transactions
              occur solely by your actions and through your chosen Mint. We do
              not monitor, verify, or facilitate transfers between you and any
              Mint or other parties.
            </p>
            <p>
              1.4 <strong>Web Server Only:</strong> Cashu.me does not operate
              any servers except for the web server that delivers the
              application to your device. The application is executed entirely
              on your device. Once the code is served, all logic executes
              locally and Cashu.me has no control over the application.
            </p>
            <p>
              1.5 <strong>Open Source Code:</strong> The application code is
              open source, meaning it can be self-hosted and run by third
              parties using different domains. Cashu.me has no control over, and
              does not endorse or assume responsibility for, any instances of
              the code running outside of the Cashu.me service. Your use of any
              such third-party instances is at your own risk.
            </p>
            <p>
              1.6 <strong>Code Disclaimer:</strong> The open-source code is
              provided without any guarantee of security, error-free operation,
              or technical support. Users must independently verify the
              authenticity, security, and integrity of the open-source code
              prior to use.
            </p>
            <p><strong>2. User Responsibilities & Disclaimers</strong></p>
            <p>
              2.1 <strong>User's Sole Responsibility:</strong> You understand
              and agree that you use the Site and Services at your own risk and
              for your own account. You alone are fully responsible for
              selecting Mints, conducting transactions, and safeguarding your
              ecash and secret values. Cashu.me is not a party to and disclaims
              any responsibility for any agreements, terms, or disputes between
              you and any Mint.
            </p>
            <p>
              2.2 <strong>No Partnership with Mints:</strong> Cashu.me is not
              affiliated with, endorsed by, or responsible for any Mint. We make
              no representations, warranties, or guarantees about any Mint's
              integrity, legality, liquidity, or functionality. Your
              relationship with any Mint, including the issuance, redemption, or
              valuation of ecash, is solely a matter between you and that Mint.
              Cashu.me is not a party to any transaction between you and any
              Mint or third party. No agency, partnership, or joint venture
              relationship is formed by your use of the Site.
            </p>
            <p>
              2.3 <strong>Risk of Ecash:</strong> Ecash is an experimental,
              bearer-like digital asset that may not be recognized as money,
              currency, or a store of value. Anyone with the secret value has
              control over the ecash. You agree to review and understand all
              risks disclosed in our Risk Disclosure Statement before using
              ecash.
            </p>
            <p><strong>3. Modifications to Terms</strong></p>
            <p>
              We may amend or update these Terms at any time without notice. You
              are advised to review these Terms periodically. Your continued use
              of the Site or Services after any modifications constitutes
              acceptance of the updated Terms. If you do not agree, discontinue
              your use.
            </p>
            <p><strong>4. Compliance with Laws</strong></p>
            <p>
              4.1 <strong>Legal Compliance:</strong> Your use of the Site and
              any Services is void where prohibited by law. You must determine
              whether your use of ecash and related activities are lawful. You
              are solely responsible for compliance with all applicable laws,
              taxes, and regulations.
            </p>
            <p>
              4.2 <strong>Not Financial Services:</strong> The Services are not
              intended to constitute regulated financial, banking, e-money, or
              payment services. You are solely responsible for determining
              whether your use of ecash or related activities requires any form
              of license, registration, or compliance with financial regulations
              in your jurisdiction.
            </p>
            <p><strong>5. License to Use the Site</strong></p>
            <p>
              Subject to your compliance with these Terms, we grant you a
              limited, personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable
              license to use the Site. We may suspend or terminate your access
              at our sole discretion.
            </p>
            <p><strong>6. Risks and Limitation of Liability</strong></p>
            <p>
              6.1 <strong>No Liability for Interactions with Mints:</strong>
              Cashu.me is not liable for any transactions, disputes, or issues
              arising from your dealings with Mints.
            </p>
            <p>
              6.2 <strong>Assumption of Risk:</strong> You acknowledge
              ecash-related activities involve significant risks, including
              market volatility, theft, and regulatory uncertainty.
            </p>
            <p>
              6.3 <strong>Waiver of Accountability:</strong> By using the Site,
              you waive any right to hold Cashu.me accountable for any damages,
              losses, or disputes arising from your use of the Site or Services.
            </p>
            <p>
              6.4 <strong>No Warranties:</strong> THE SITE AND SERVICES ARE
              PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT ANY WARRANTIES. WE DISCLAIM ALL
              WARRANTIES TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.
            </p>
            <p>
              6.5 <strong>Limitation of Liability:</strong> TO THE FULLEST
              EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, CASHU.ME IS NOT LIABLE FOR INDIRECT,
              INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARISING
              OUT OF OR RELATED TO THESE TERMS, THE SITE, OR THE SERVICES.
            </p>
            <p>
              6.6 <strong>Maximum Liability:</strong> To the maximum extent
              permitted by applicable law, the Site and Services are provided
              'as is' without warranties of any kind. This does not affect any
              statutory warranties or rights which cannot be excluded under your
              jurisdiction's law.
            </p>
            <p><strong>7. Indemnification and Release</strong></p>
            <p>
              You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Cashu.me and its
              affiliates from claims arising out of your use of the Site or
              Services. If you have a dispute with any Mint or third party, you
              release Cashu.me from all related claims.
            </p>
            <p><strong>8. Mediation and Dispute Resolution</strong></p>
            <p>
              8.1 <strong>Mediation Requirement:</strong> If a dispute arises
              out of or relates to these Terms, the Site, or the Services, the
              parties agree to first attempt to resolve the dispute through
              good-faith mediation administered by a reputable mediation
              provider. Each party shall bear its own costs for the mediation,
              and the costs of the mediator shall be shared equally.
            </p>
            <p>
              8.2 <strong>Arbitration Option:</strong> If mediation does not
              resolve the dispute within 30 days (or a mutually agreed period),
              either party may initiate final and binding arbitration
              administered by a reputable arbitration provider within the user's
              jurisdiction. Arbitration shall be conducted on an individual
              basis, and class actions or collective proceedings are not
              permitted.
            </p>
            <p>
              8.3 <strong>Waiver of Jury Trial:</strong> If arbitration is not
              invoked and the dispute proceeds to court, you waive your right to
              a trial by jury to the fullest extent permitted by the governing
              law of your jurisdiction.
            </p>
            <p>
              8.4 <strong>EU Consumer Rights:</strong> If you are residing in
              the EU, any mandatory statutory rights regarding dispute
              resolution procedures remain unaffected by this clause. Nothing in
              this Section 8 shall limit or affect any mandatory rights you may
              have under EU consumer protection or other applicable statutory
              laws.
            </p>
            <p><strong>9. Prohibited Uses</strong></p>
            <p>
              You may not use the Site or Services for unlawful activities, to
              violate applicable laws, or to engage in market manipulation. We
              may suspend or terminate access for prohibited uses. You agree not
              to use the Site or Services to engage in any activity that
              violates applicable anti-money laundering (AML), counter-terrorism
              financing (CTF), or other financial crime regulations. Any use of
              the Site or Services for unlawful or fraudulent purposes is
              strictly prohibited.
            </p>
            <p><strong>10. Privacy and Data Protection</strong></p>
            <p>
              10.1 <strong>GDPR Compliance:</strong> Cashu.me does not collect
              or store any personal data, including IP addresses. No data is
              shared with third parties. As such, Cashu.me does not engage in
              data processing activities that would subject it to GDPR or
              similar regulations. Users remain responsible for ensuring their
              own device's security and verifying the authenticity of the code
              they run.
            </p>
            <p>
              10.2 <strong>Security:</strong> Because the code executes entirely
              on your device and no personal data is collected, Cashu.me does
              not perform any data processing activities that would fall under
              the GDPR or similar data protection laws.
            </p>
            <p>
              10.3 <strong>Local Data:</strong> Any data or information stored
              locally on your device, including browser storage, cookies, or
              application state, is controlled by you and not transmitted to or
              accessible by Cashu.me.
            </p>
            <p><strong>11. Your Representations and Warranties</strong></p>
            <p>
              You represent and warrant you have the right and authority to
              enter into these Terms and that your use of the Site will be
              lawful.
            </p>
            <p><strong>12. No Investment Advice</strong></p>
            <p>
              Cashu.me does not provide investment, legal, or tax advice. No
              fiduciary, advisory, or trust relationship is formed between you
              and Cashu.me by using the Site or Services.
            </p>
            <p><strong>13. No Waiver</strong></p>
            <p>
              No failure or delay to exercise any right by Cashu.me shall
              constitute a waiver of that right.
            </p>
            <p><strong>14. Force Majeure</strong></p>
            <p>
              Cashu.me is not liable for delays or failures due to events beyond
              our reasonable control.
            </p>
            <p><strong>15. Assignment</strong></p>
            <p>
              You may not assign your rights without our consent. We may assign
              our rights freely.
            </p>
            <p><strong>16. Severability</strong></p>
            <p>
              If any provision is deemed invalid, remaining provisions remain in
              effect.
            </p>
            <p><strong>17. Electronic Communications; Language</strong></p>
            <p>
              By using the Site or Services, you consent to receive
              communications electronically. We will communicate in English.
            </p>
            <p><strong>18. Governing Law</strong></p>
            <p>
              18.1 <strong>Choice of Law:</strong>
              These Terms and any dispute arising from or related to these
              Terms, the Site, or the Services shall be governed by the
              applicable laws of your jurisdiction, without regard to conflict
