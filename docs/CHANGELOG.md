# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Buckets UI redesign â€“ Phase9
- Bucket detail opens in a modal from the Buckets page.
  Direct links to `/buckets/:id` still work but are only kept
  for backward compatibility. Navigate to `/buckets` and select
  "Manage" on a bucket to open the modal.
- Bucket detail modal includes a History tab.
- Documented iframe snippet support and Nostr event link embedding for media previews. These previews also show when viewing tiers from the find creators page.
